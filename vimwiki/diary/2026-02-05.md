# 2.5 怎么才能确定目标呢
## TODO
1. [X] 修复wall.sh，有时候失效的问题
2. [X] patch center to dmenu
3. [X] 算法题
4. [X] linear algebra
5. [X] 投简历
6. [X] 确定方向，往这个方向上学习开源项目，做提交，做贡献,但是难在不知道方向。。
7. [X] 截图 use flameshot
8. [ ] 有时间看看开源代码

## 目标
思考一下喜欢的方向，好好研究，找工作拿出东西来更让人信服

* AI
* 机器人
* 嵌入式
* linux系统，内核
* 运维开发
* 游戏

说实话哪个领域我都得学习好多东西。
这段我会记在main index上吧，今天肯定想不出来

## alogrithm
1. design circular queue (node & vecotr)
2. some articles for queue
3. number of island (bfs & dfs)

## math
> Linerar combinations, span and basis vectors

昨天晚上看了一遍 ，结果完全没看懂。基本上从span开始就不知道说啥了- -.

今天打算对照[文字版](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/span#title)再看一遍，
大学挂的最多的现代和高数，竟然现在要补回来- -。

看完了文字版的，确实对span,linearly dependent等terminology有了一些了解,
只是还是英文的能力问题，导致还需要翻译一些东西才能看懂

## 投简历
投了一个小时简历，有两个回复的，还是那种感觉很悬的。

网约车又开始找我了，真是个一段时间看你找不到工作就来啊- -.

## 家务
* 洗衣服，刷锅

## 家庭
- 小默默拿了好多张湿纸巾擦窗台，让我说了一顿哭了。哭完小默默就出来拿小扫把自己扫地了，哎。
- 下午还得带他俩去兰科其补课
- 小默默有点无聊在家，他更喜欢动，小栗子本身就是不爱动，还有作业，所以她在家呆得住。

## 英语学习
### **The Old Man And The Sea**
there is so many new word.

> squishes: stretches or squishes vecotrs
> scalors:标量
> revolves: move in a circle on a central axis

> bread on penuins
all you have to do is show up

I just wondering what to focus on, her video is showing up. I like what's her saying.

* dont't worry about the results.
* dont't worry about the end product.
* just think about right now, where am i putting my effort? Am I going to show up? Am I going to try my best here?
* the only failure is just never starting on the thing and never doing it.
* just pushing forward, nomatter where you are
* try your best and that is all you need to do. if you keep trying your best, you will eventually get to the results that you want.
* but if you fixate on those results, you're just going to be sitting there thinking ablout everything that you're not achieving 
instead of what you can do in this very moment to go forwards.

to be hostly, it's what i am thinking about. where am i putting my best?

### extra linear algebra note
> "Mathematics requires a small dose, not a genius, but of an imaginative freedom which, in a larger dose, would be insanity."

List some questions before reading.
1. What is linear combinations?
2. What is span?
3. What is basis vectors?

Answer:
1. linear combinations: scaling two vectors and adding them.
2. span: the set of all possible vecotrs you can reach with linear combinations of a given pair of vectors is called the "span" of those two vectors.
3. basis vectors: they are scale vecotrs, changing it can make a new coordinate system.

> linearly dependent: you could remove one without reducing their span
> on the other hand, it said linearly independent
